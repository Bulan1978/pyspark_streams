# pyspark_streams_simulation
Simulation of streams data ingestion using pyspark.

I found this video in youtube and recreated to learn streams usage with pyspark. The spark, pyspark and java installations were done in the Google Colab drive, which eliminated any requirement of local workstation installation.

The source project which I referred is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLfTxtgeVhM&list=LL

- Challenges faced :

  • Splitting the original dataset into part datasets to simulate streams, writing the output tables in memory. 
  
- Tools / techniques used :

  • Google colab along with pyspark libraries.
    
- Project outcome :
  
  • Output tables from the part datasets.
